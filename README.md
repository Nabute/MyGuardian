# My Guardian


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://www.gdgaddis.dev)

The Guardian is an application that can be used to report an accident happening to an individual into an Emergency number. It implements a machine learning model trained to detect a violence using voice from the environment.

  - Mobile and Smart Watch Application
  - Google Assistant
  - Machine Learning


### Used technologies

The Guardian uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) - An end-to-end open source machine learning platform.
* [Keras](https://keras.io/) - An open-source neural-network library written in Python.
* [Librosa](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/) - A python package for music and audio analysis.
* [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/) - Google Assistant is an artificial intelligence-powered virtual assistant developed by Google that is primarily available on mobile and smart home devices.
* [App Actions](https://developers.google.com/assistant/app) - Launch and deep link into Android apps from the Google Assistant.

And of course the Guadrian itself is open source with a public repository on GitHub.
